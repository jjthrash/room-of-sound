# Glossary of Terms

Arduino: A family of microcontrollers. Unlike Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos lack full-fledged operating systems and must be programmed using another computer connected via USB. 
Arduinos are usually only loaded with only one program. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino. Also see Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller.

Clone: To copy a remote repository to a computer. See https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/. Also see Repository. 

GitHub: A repository-hosting website that we use in this project. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub. Also see Repository.

GH: See GitHub.

Local Repository: See Repository.

Microcontroller: A small computer that can be used to control electronic components like motors and LED's. Some microcontrollers, like Raspberry Pi's, are full-fledged computers;
others, like Arduinos, can only execute one program. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller. Also see Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

MIDI: Short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI is the communications protocol that we are using in this project. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI. Also see MIDI Cable, MIDI Event, USB, and RTP-MIDI.

MIDI Cable: A five-pin cable designed specifically for transmitting MIDI Events. Older than USB and RTP-MIDI. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI#Connectors.
Also see USB, RTP-MIDI, and MIDI Events.

MIDI Events: A MIDI command comprised of a few bytes. For specific events and their codes, see http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/formats/midi-event.html. Also see MIDI.

PR: See Pull Request.

Pull Request: A request to combine two different versions of a repository. See https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/.

Python: A relatively easy-to-use general-purpose programming language. There are two major types of Python: Python 2 and Python 3. The two variants are very similar, but have notable differences in key areas.
Interestingly, Python uses whitespace instead of curly braces to denote scope. Python is often used in Raspberry Pi programming. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language). Also see Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi: A small system-on-a-chip microcontroller that (often) runs a brand of Linux called Raspbian. Unlike Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's can be used like normal computers; Raspberry Pi's can be programmed like normal Linux systems. Python is one of the most common programming languages used to program Raspberry Pi's.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi. Also see Arduino, Microcontroller, and Python.

Recursion: See Recursion.

Remote Repository: See Repository.

Repository: A project on GitHub, which often contains multiple files of multiple types and sometimes wiki pages. Repositories can be local, which means stored and accessed on your computer,
or remote, which means stored by GitHub. See https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/;
Also see Clone, GitHub, and Pull Request.

RPi: See Raspberry Pi.

RTP-MIDI: If expanded, the acronym becomes Real Time-Packet Musical Instrument Digital Interface. A standard for transmitting MIDI Events over Wifi.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP-MIDI. Also see RTP, MIDI, and MIDI Event.

USB: Stands for Universal Serial Bus. The cable standard used by most modern devices; MIDI events can be transferred using this standard. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB. Also see RTP-MIDI, MIDI cable.
